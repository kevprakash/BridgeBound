To clone for use in Unreal Engine:

1) Make an empty folder (anywhere, you can do it on your desktop if convenient)
2) In the folder, open cmd or gitbash and run:

     git init
     
     git remote add origin https://github.com/kevprakash/BridgeBound.git
     
     git pull origin master
3) Once you do that, make a new third person example project in Unreal (version 4.16)
4) Close Unreal
5) Copy all the files from the intial folder you made into your project folder, overriding all files when asked
6) Open up the project and go to "Source Control" -> Set the type to Git and hit accept
