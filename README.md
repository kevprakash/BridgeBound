To clone for use in Unreal Engine.
1) Make a new Third Person example project
2) In the editor click on "Source Control" -> "Initialize Git"
3) Close Unreal
4) In the folder with the .gitignore file (your main project folder), open up command line and run:
  
       git remote add origin https://github.com/kevprakash/BridgeBound.git
  
       git pull
  
5) Once you do that, open up your project again. It may ask if you want to import changes, say yes if it does.
6) You should be up to date with the project.
